# TO DO LIST

## DONE

(done) Shader toy in python test project
(done) Shader toy port worked! added delta time,
    including multiple particles (circles)
(done) working gravity simulation between two bodies (slightly glitchy)
(done) port of mandelbrot set
(done?) Unity Compute shader setup (most basic implementation)

## IDEAS

Presentation will have three renders, do I need three instances open, or can i have multiple renders in one project?

## WHAT'S LEFT


Unity multi kernel / buffer render test

Unity MandelBrot (follow tutorial)
Unity slime port / multi agent simulation
Unity N body simulation
Unity boid simulation

Project Paper (1 - 2 Pages)
