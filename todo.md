(done) Shader toy in python test project
(done) Shader toy port worked! added delta time,

(done) working gravity simulation between two bodies (slightly glitchy)
(done) port of mandelbrot set

## IDEAS

original mandelbrot?

## WHAT'S LEFT

port basic Shader toy into unity
Unity Compute shader setup (most basic implementation)

N body simulation
boid simulation

plus artistic additions
