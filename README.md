# ShortTerm2024
Bates 2024 Short Term for Computational and Mathematical Art

This includes prototypes and builds of projects for the short term, including shadertoy adaptations.
mostly using the python-arcade shadertoy library to easily display and test opengl instances without configuring everything myself.

I've included a document that contains all of the sources that have gone into this project.
