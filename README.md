# ShortTerm2024
Bates 2024 Short Term for Computational and Mathematical Art

This includes prototypes and builds of projects for the short term, including shadertoy adaptations and Unity compute shaders.

Shadertoy used the python-arcade shadertoy library to easily display and test opengl instances without having configure boilerplate openGL myself.
The final project consists of compute shader renders using the built in HLSL support Unity provides in its rendering pipeline.

"resources.md" contains all of the sources that have gone into this project, including inpsiration, tutorials, threads, and utils.
